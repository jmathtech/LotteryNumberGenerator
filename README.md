# Lottery Number Generator
A 'lucky number' generator for a lottery game in the U.S. Good luck!
The lottery numbers are selected with a range of 1-69 for the five white ball numbers and a range of 1-26 for the red ball number. 
This program will select random numbers and put them in order to play on a lotto playslip.


## How to use the program
Download the .ZIP file from this repository and extract it. Then, run the main.py in a terminal window with this command

```bash
sudo sh ./main.py
```

or an IDE program like Pycharm, etc to run this python script.


## How to play
Choose any of the selected numbers from the python program and go to the store to play those numbers on the lottery playslip. 

``` python
# NOTE: This number generator is NOT a way to actually win the lottery. 
# However, I programmed this python program to select numbers that haven't been selected
# within the script so that the combination sequence will change frequently and won't choose the same numbers for you.
# This program has been built for entertainment purposes only and NOT a way to 'hack' the lottery system. 
# Play responsible and GOOD LUCK! :)
